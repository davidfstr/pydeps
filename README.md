# pydeps

Visualizes dependencies between Python modules.

## Usage

Just run the `pydeps.py` command with a path to a directory containing Python source files.

```
python pydeps.py ~/Projects/CPM/src output.dot
```

The output is a `.dot` file, which can be rendered with [GraphViz].

And marvel as your program's modules and their dependencies become visible:

## Output Notes

* Nodes are Python modules. Edges are `imports` from one module to another.

* Edge thickness is proportional to the number of imports.

    * Therefore the thickness approximates the amount of coupling between adjacent modules.

* Yellow modules contain a main function (via the idiom `if __name__ == 'main':`).

    * Since modules with main functions are typically standalone programs or commands,
      it's a good idea to avoid depending on them.

* System modules are excluded from the graph.

    * A system module is defined as any module which resides outside the specified source directory.

## Fun Ideas

* Create an animated history of your program's growth over time:

    * Write a program that checks out each revision of your program,
      runs `pydeps.py`, and uses the `dot` tool to generate an image.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
    * Earlier versions probably work too, but I haven't tested them.
* [GraphViz] &mdash; to render the output `.dot` files
